                                Unified communication defines smooth running of businesses and also reflects the company’s need to go that extra mile when it comes to staying connected. Without communication none of the services would render the right objective. Clearly, unified communication and IP telephony helps clients stay connected wherever, whenever and this amplifies profitability and business expansion in many ways.

                                It is not only important to manage your data but also streamline it with a scheduled and proper delivery system. Proper switching and routing puts method to all the chaos and streamlines the delivery of data on time without any glitches. Routing that is highly scalable, easy to implement without disruption with dynamic networking is the need of the time. Konnet’s expertise in switching and routing has the best technology to help you optimize your infrastructural capabilities.

                                Virtual Device Contexts is Cisco’s 7000 series switches that can be segmented into virtual devices and it has the benefits of administration plane, fault isolation, enhanced security and much more. IN addition to VDCs, Virtual Port Channels enables a server or switch to use an ether channel to help use up all the uplink bandwidth that is available. To take DC switching a step further, our continuous system operation helps in maintenance, upgrades and software certifications that can be performed without service interruptions.
                                Cisco’s NX-OS provides outstanding data confidentiality and integrity. 
                                It provides multiple layer security with access control links for post-security too. 
                                Our Overlay transport virtualization enables layer 2 extensions between distributed data centers. 
                                In addition to the above we also provide NX-OS Persistent Storage Service to help restart a process, 
                                switch over to a redundant supervisor module and fabric path enables each device to build an overall

                                We use various connectivity modules for more flexibility and agility that can enable constant connection. Viptela is altering the traditional concepts by altering data and control plane connectivity model by use of SDN to create and SDN WAN technology. In addition to SDN we have Route reflector designs. These have a huge advantage of being able to be positioned anywhere on the network as they do not have to sit on the data path. With ISR Routers we help you accomplish a lot in no time and consistently. It allows high-quality user experience, as faster response to business and user needs, a wide-range of connectivity options and unified communication.
